# Bee_Detection
The project "Tracking Bees with Object Recognition" seeks to create advanced object recognition algorithms capable of identifying individual bees and tracking their movements over time. This project uses state-of-the-art pretrained networks, such as YOLO, and unique data augmentation strategies to improve model performance with a comprehensive dataset of approximately 10,000 annotated bee pictures. Furthermore, the study will investigate optimisation ways to cut classification time, allowing for analysis of video feeds.
